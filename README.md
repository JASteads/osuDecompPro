# osuDecompPro

A small project that enables developers to import a .osu file into an OsuFile object. Developers can ..

- Import any .osu file to have converted into an OsuFile object.
- Access and modify all of the OsuFile's contents directly.
- Export an OsuFile's data into a new .osu file.

NOTE : Do NOT import/export .osu files with storyboards. There is currently no support for .osu files with storyboards. Importing a .osu file with a storyboard may produce undesirable results.
